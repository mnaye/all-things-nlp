John Stephen Piper (born January 11, 1946) is a theologian, pastor, and chancellor of Bethlehem College & Seminary in Minneapolis, Minnesota.[2] Piper taught Biblical Studies at Bethel University for six years (1974-1980), before serving as Pastor for Preaching and Vision of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis for 33 years (1980-2013).[3]

Piper is the founder and senior teacher of desiringGod.org, named for his book Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist (1986), and has written a number of award-winning books, including ECPA Christian Book Award winners Spectacular Sins,[4] What Jesus Demands from the World,[5] Pierced by the Word,[6] and God's Passion for His Glory,[7] as well as bestsellers Don't Waste Your Life[8] and The Passion of Jesus Christ.

Piper was born on January 11, 1946, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to Bill and Ruth Piper.[10] His father was a traveling evangelist for over 60 years.[11] Before Piper was one year old, his family moved to Greenville, South Carolina, where he spent the remainder of his youth, graduating from Wade Hampton High School in 1964.

According to Piper, he had a religious conversion at his mother's knee while on a family vacation in Florida when he was six years old.[12] Piper has remarked that the fact he was converted aged six "blows him away", not because he remembers the event, but due to his belief in the Bible's telling of the hopeless condition of all humans who have not been converted.[13][14]

Piper married Noël Henry in December 1968,[15] and together they have four sons, a daughter, and 12 grandchildren.[16] He attended Wheaton College between 1964 and 1968, majoring in literature and minoring in philosophy. Studying romantic literature with Clyde Kilby led him to take particular interest in poetry,[17] and Piper continues to compose poetry to celebrate family occasions, as well as annually composing poems based on biblical characters for his congregation during the four weeks of Advent.[18]

In college, Piper originally wanted to pursue a career in medicine, before deciding to go into ministry during a bout of mononucleosis, while listening to the sermons of Harold Ockenga over the radio from his hospital bed.[19] Piper received his Bachelor of Divinity degree from Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California.[20] While at Fuller, Piper took several courses from Daniel Fuller, and through him discovered the writings of Jonathan Edwards.[21] Along with C. S. Lewis,[22] Edwards[23] and Fuller[24] are noted influences in Piper's life and ministry.

Piper received his Doctor of Theology degree in New Testament Studies at the University of Munich, Germany (1971–1974) under Leonhard Goppelt. His dissertation, Love Your Enemies, was published by Cambridge University Press and Baker Book House. Upon completion of his doctorate, Piper taught Biblical Studies at Bethel University and Seminary in Saint Paul, Minnesota, for six years between 1974 and 1980.[25]

Piper's mother died on December 16, 1974, in a bus wreck in Israel;[26] in 1990, a tribute to her was included in Piper's booklet What's the Difference?.

In 1980, Piper became pastor of Bethlehem Baptist Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he ministered until March 31, 2013. Piper became involved in evangelical Christianity following the publication of his book Desiring God: Meditations of a Christian Hedonist in 1986, and has continued to publish dozens of books further articulating his theological perspective. In 1994, Piper founded Desiring God Ministries, with the aim of "spread[ing] a passion for the supremacy of God in all things for the joy of all peoples through Jesus Christ".[27] Desiring God Ministries offers all of Piper's sermons and articles from the past three decades—and most of his books—online at no cost.

Piper took an eight month leave of absence from his ministry from May 1, 2010, to January 9, 2011.[28][29][30] He announced in June 2011 that he would soon step down from his role of pastor. A candidate to succeed him was announced in March 2012,[2] and on May 20, 2012, Jason Meyer was voted in (784 yes to 8 no) to be the next Pastor for Preaching & Vision, replacing Piper.

On March 31, 2013 (Easter Sunday), Piper preached his final sermon as pastor of Bethlehem Baptist[3] and announced in an open letter to the congregation that he and his family would be moving to Tennessee for at least a year, in order for the church's new leadership to develop a strategic vision for the church without distractions.
