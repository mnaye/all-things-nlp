Marjorie Taylor Greene (born May 27, 1974), also known by her initials MTG,[2] is an American politician, businesswoman, and far-right[3] conspiracy theorist[4] serving as the U.S. representative for Georgia's 14th congressional district.[5] A member of the Republican Party and a staunch supporter of Donald Trump, Greene was elected to Congress in November 2020 and sworn into office on January 3, 2021.

Greene has supported disproven far-right conspiracy theories such as Pizzagate and QAnon,[6][7] as well as other unevidenced conspiracy theories including false flag shootings and 9/11 conspiracy theories.[8][9] Additionally, before running for Congress, she supported the execution of prominent Democratic politicians.[10] Greene also supported Trump's efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

During the Electoral College vote count, Greene was among a group of Republican legislators who unsuccessfully objected to votes won by Biden,[11] despite federal agencies overseeing election security saying it was the most secure in American history.[12][13][14] After falsely asserting Trump was elected in a landslide but the election had been stolen from him, Greene filed articles of impeachment against Biden the day after his inauguration, alleging abuse of power.[15][16] The House of Representatives voted to remove Greene from all committee roles in response to a series of incendiary and violent statements that she had previously made. Eleven Republicans joined the unanimous Democrats in the vote on February 4, 2021.
