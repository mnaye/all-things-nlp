Joel Scott Osteen (born March 5, 1963)[2] is an American pastor, televangelist, and author, based in Houston, Texas. As of 2018, Osteen's televised sermons were seen by approximately 10 million viewers in the US and several million more in over 100 countries weekly.[3] Osteen has also written several best-selling books. Osteen was born in Houston, Texas, and is one of six children of John Osteen and Dolores ("Dodie") Pilgrim. His father, a former Southern Baptist pastor, founded Lakewood Church (of which Osteen is the current senior pastor) in the back of an old feed store.[5] He graduated from Humble High School, a public high school in the city of Humble, Texas, in 1981,[6] and attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he studied radio and television communications, but did not graduate; he did not receive a degree from a divinity school.[7][8] In 1982, he returned to Houston, founded Lakewood's television program, and produced his father's televised sermons for 17 years until January 1999, when his father died unexpectedly from a heart attack.  Osteen's father encouraged him to preach for many years, but he declined, preferring to work behind the scenes until January 17, 1999, when he accepted his father's suggestion and preached his first sermon. John Osteen died six days later of a heart attack. Two weeks after his father's death, Osteen began preaching regularly and later that year was installed as the new senior pastor of Lakewood Church on October 3, 1999.[10] As of 2014, Lakewood's attendance had grown from 5,000 to 43,000.[11]

In 2003, Lakewood Church acquired the Compaq Center, former home of the NBA Houston Rockets and the AHL Houston Aeros. Renovations cost $105 million.[12] The renovations took over 15 months to complete, and included the addition of five stories to add more capacity.[13] Lakewood's 2005 grand opening was attended by an estimated 56,000 people, including Texas Governor Rick Perry and then-House Minority Leader and future Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.[14] According to Osteen in 2008, Lakewood Church's weekly service TV program was viewed in more than 100 countries.[15] Lakewood Church estimates that 7 million viewers per week watch the services.[16][circular reference]

Osteen was included on Barbara Walters's list of the 10 Most Fascinating People of 2006.[17][18] Former presidential candidate John McCain described Osteen as his favorite inspirational author.[19] The Osteen family attended Easter breakfast hosted by President Barack Obama at the White House in 2010.Osteen's sermon preparation involves memorizing his remarks and listening to himself on tape.[21] Osteen says he chooses to focus more on the goodness of God and on living an obedient life rather than on sin.[22] He says that he tries to teach Biblical principles in a simple way, emphasizing the power of love and a positive attitude.[23] When asked why he does not focus more on sin, the devil and hell in detail, Osteen stated in an interview with CBN News:

When I grew up, the devil was a reason why I had a headache or the devil was the reason I got mad today. We always blamed the devil. I think today when I say the enemy, I like to make it broader. Sometimes the enemy can be our own thoughts. We've trained ourselves the wrong way. Or the enemy can be our own lack of discipline. Some people preach about hell like you're already going there, and to me the Gospel means 'Good News.' I'd rather say God is a God of mercy. So I think the people already know what they're doing wrong, and I certainly believe in hell. But to me, when I see thousands of people before me, it just doesn't come out of me to say, 'You guys are terrible, and you're going to hell.' I'd rather say that God is a God of mercy. You've got to live an obedient life, but for every mistake you've made, there's mercy there, and I believe we can do better.
