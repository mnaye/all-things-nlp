Granville Oral Roberts (January 24, 1918 â€“ December 15, 2009[1][2]) was an American Charismatic Christian televangelist, ordained in both the Pentecostal Holiness and United Methodist churches. He is considered the godfather of the charismatic movement and was one of the most recognized preachers in the US at the height of his fame.[3] He founded the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association and Oral Roberts University.

As one of the most well-known and controversial American religious leaders of the 20th century, his preaching emphasized seed-faith.[4] His ministries reached millions of followers worldwide spanning a period of over six decades.[5] His healing ministry and bringing American Pentecostalism into the mainstream had the most impact,[6] but he also pioneered televangelism and laid the foundations of the prosperity gospel[5] and abundant life teachings.[7] The breadth and style of his ministry, including his widely publicized funding appeals, made him a consistent subject of contention among critics and supporters.
